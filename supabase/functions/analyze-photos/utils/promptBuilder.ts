- If you identify a specific product (brand + model), provide realistic measurements based on product specifications
- Research current market prices for similar items
- Write compelling, detailed descriptions that highlight key features and condition

MEASUREMENT GUIDELINES:
- If you identify a specific product, provide realistic measurements based on typical specifications

- For electronics, check typical product specifications
- Only use "N/A" if the product is completely unidentifiable
